# C Programming Examples
# C Programming Examples Repository

This repository contains various example codes related to the **C programming language**. The examples cover fundamental concepts such as:

- **Data types and variables**
- **Operators and expressions**
- **Conditional statements (if-else, switch-case)**
- **Loops (for, while, do-while)**
- **Functions and modular programming**
- **Pointers and memory management**
- **File handling**
- **And more advanced topics...**

## How the Code Structure Works

Each example is implemented as a separate function following this format:

```c
void example162() {
    // Example 162 implementation
    printf("Hello from example162!\n");
}

int main() {
    printf("\nexample162:\n");
    example162();  // Runs only example162
    return 0;
}
```

This means that you can **easily run any specific example** just by updating `main()` with the desired example function call.

## Running the Code

To compile and run the examples, you can use a standard C compiler like `gcc`:

```sh
gcc work.c -o work
./work
```

Modify the `main()` function to call any example you want.
